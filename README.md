# Chat with a Website from URL - LangChain Chatbot with Streamlit GUI

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Interactive Website Chatbot!üöÄ This project showcases a robust chatbot application that interacts with websites to extract and present information dynamically. The solution combines the power of LangChain with a Streamlit-based user interface for seamless and interactive user experiences.

## Features
- **Website Interaction**: Utilizing the latest version of LangChain, this chatbot can seamlessly extract and leverage information from a variety of websites.
- **Integration with Large Language Models**: The chatbot is compatible with advanced models like GPT-4, Mistral, Llama2, and ollama. The default configuration uses GPT-3.5, however, you can easily switch to other models as needed.
- **Streamlit GUI**: Features a clean and intuitive user interface crafted with Streamlit, suitable for users of all technical backgrounds.
- **Python-based Framework**: Fully implemented in Python for ease of use and customization.

## How RAG(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Works

1. **Query Submission:** The user submits a query or question to the RAG system.
2. **Information Retrieval:** The IR component searches a database or knowledge source to retrieve relevant documents, passages, or information related to the query. [[3]](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/)
3. **Context Integration:** The retrieved information is then provided as additional context to the LLM, along with the original query. [[1]](https://telnyx.com/resources/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag)
4. **Response Generation:** The LLM generates a response by considering both the query and the retrieved context, allowing it to produce more accurate, up-to-date, and relevant answers. [[4]](https://www.superannotate.com/blog/rag-explained)
5. **User Presentation:** The generated response is presented to the user, often with citations or references to the sources used from the retrieved information. [[3]](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/)

In essence, RAG combines the generative power of LLMs with the ability to dynamically access and incorporate external knowledge sources. [[2]](https://vox.veritas.com/t5/Veritas-AI-Group/What-is-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-or-RAG/td-p/903265) This approach addresses the limitations of LLMs, such as knowledge cutoff dates and lack of domain-specific or real-time information, by augmenting them with relevant data from external sources. [[4]](https://www.superannotate.com/blog/rag-explained)[[1]](https://telnyx.com/resources/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag)

The key steps involve parsing the query, retrieving relevant information (often using vector embeddings and semantic search), providing the retrieved context to the LLM, and generating a response that integrates the external knowledge with the LLM's capabilities.

## Interface Display of the Interactive Chatbot
<img width="1427" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Phoenix0415/chat_with_websites/assets/94208127/c4a2049a-95a4-4100-97d3-dd54a90e9b7f">

The image above shows the user interface of this Interactive Website Chatbot with the URL 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election' entered in the sidebar. Despite using GPT-3.5, which does not contain this latest information in its training data, the chatbot can display current information by retrieving data directly from the specified URL.
